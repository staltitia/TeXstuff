PREVIOUS CO-OP EXPERIENCE

HRI-JP											January 2013 - August 2013
Psychophysics Experiment Software Developer
	
	Developed experiment programs that provides audio-visual stimulus, records subject responses and saves results into a .csv
	Built program to calculate subject's head position using OpenCV and spherical markers
	Wrote MATLAB script to perform statistical analysis and plot graphs of multiple subjects for comparison
	Tested hypotheses by performing experiments on multiple subjects in controlled environments
	Presented findings before research staff upon completion of the work term
	
Epic 3D Tech									May 2012 - August 2012
Embedded Systems Engineer
	
	Developed an Arduino program to control four stepper motors that move a two camera rig for automated 3D filming
	Wrote algorithm to convert physical position and angles to stepper motor steps based upon the physical dimensions of the camera rig
	Designed calibration and fail safe system using micro-switches and H-bridge circuit, and PCB to power the stepper motor
	Built control interface Android application that communicates with the Arduino micro-controller via a bluetooth module
	Documented and commented code written to allow for future development and improvement of the programs
	
UBC, Department of Physics and Astronomy		September 2011 - December 2011
PHYS 102 MRI Software Developer

	Developed a server in C++ for an Arduino micro-controller to accept instructions according to a set protocol through a serial port
	Programmed a client in C to convert instructions in text format into the set protocol and send it over the serial port to the Arduino server, and to receive the data collected
	Built a graphic user interface (GUI) in Python to streamline the use of the C program, graph the data collected, and reconstruct the image of the sample being scanned by the MRI machine
	Wrote roughly 5000 lines of code across 3 programming languages throughout the course of the work term 
	Documented the code and wrote the instruction manual for the use of the program
	Designed templates for the gradient coils used to induce a magnetic gradient field for the imaging

TECHNICAL PROJECTS

Photonics System Modelling						January 2014 - April 2014

	Designed silicon-based Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZI) and Fabry-Perot (FP) Interferometers using KLayout, a layout editor for .gds files
	Constructed numerical model in MATLAB for the ideal behaviour of fabricated photonics device
	Measured frequency response of devices using apparatus measuring output intensity during an input frequency sweep
	Adjusted model to match measured response of each respective device by varying device dimensions variables of MATLAB model
	Inferred physical device dimensions based upon adjustments to model
	
SEM Control System								September 2013 - April 2014

	Reverse engineered working scanning electron microscope (SEM) using documentation and schematics
	Designed system to interface analog circuitry to digital I/O using ADCs and DACs
	Developed control system using VHDL on an Altera DE II to read input from ADCs, provide output to DACs and communicate with a PC attached via serial
	Built GUI with a Python backend to allow user to control the SEM's current state, and to reconstruct images generated by the SEM

VHDL Implementation of Basic Computer			January 2012 - April 2012

	Designed a basic computer that can compute the result of arithmetic operations upon values stored within registers, and store the result in a register
	Programmed a Cyclone II FPGA using VHDL to make a basic computer consisting of a register bank, data path, arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and a finite state machine (FSM)
	Planned a system where a series of switches control the operations of the computer, including type of operation, origin and destination registers, and input values, akin to an ASM instruction
	Built a finite-state machine to control the execution of more complex operations, which require multiple steps to complete

Rover											April 2011
	Built a rover with a metal chassis, two DC motors, an 8052 microcontroller and three inductors capable of following a wire by detecting the AC current flowing through it
	Wired the rover's 8052 microcontroller to interpret the inductor's induced voltage with distance and orientation between the rover and the path indicated by the wire
	Programmed the microcontroller in C using a small device C compiler to detect and count wires perpendicular to the main track, interpret them as instructions which were then executed
	Worked in a group on the hardware, planning the algorithm and the writing of the code
	Tested and troubleshot the code written by running the rover on the track, observing behaviour and determining modifications required
