Re: Junior Software Developer Position

I decided to enter the engineering profession because I firmly believe the most positive way to impact our world is to build.
This is because I am a firm believer that the surest way to positively impact our world is the creation of new technologies.
What keeps increasing this world's interconnectivity is the work of firms like yours, and the work of corporations like your push us into the future. 
I believe that my 
programming and scripting skills and
experience developing for embedded systems
make me a good fit for this position.

%Proficiency in C/C++ development for embedded systems;
During my first co-op work term at UBC, I was tasked with the development of a mini-MRI control system using an Arduino, which communicated with a PC.
The Arduino program was coded in C++, and the PC ran a program written in Python, which had a GUI component, processed data collected by the 
micro-controller, and graphed it on the PC's monitor as the data streamed in.
%Proficiency in using compilers, linkers, emulators, debugging tools and revision control tools;
Throughout my coding experience, I have had to use different methods of compiling an executable program. 
In my schoolwork, I used Visual Studio; during my work at UBC, I used GNU Make and during my work at Epic 3D, I used CMake.
I've also used Git for version control.
%Experience with scripting languages such as Python or Ruby
%Hardware design and debug experience
I've also been tasked with circuit design and testing, using tools like oscilloscopes to analyse waveforms and debug the circuit.

As an individual I have had a track record of being enthusiastic while being even keeled. 
I am proavtive in bridging gaps in my knowledge and skills, and am motivated by learning new things.
As an engineering student, I have been subject to many short-term as well as term-length projects.
In many of these projects, I have had to present the results of the project before my peers and instructors.
Through the course of my time as a student, I have had to write many essays, proposals, reports and memoranda, giving me a deal of experience in writing.
Thank you for taking the time to read this cover letter.
I look forward to further discussing my qualifications with you in person.

Ericsson is a global force in the telecommunications industry. Our office in Burnaby, BC is currently looking for a talented Software Developer to 
join our Platform as a Service: Network Synchronization team. This team is involved in developing IEEE1588/ Precision Time Protocol (PTP) and 
Synchronous Ethernet software for Ericsson’s Mobile Backhaul solutions.

In this role, you will work on leading edge projects for the Smart Services Router. You’ll have a wide scope, and depth, of constantly growing 
responsibilities including full life-cycle development.

The ideal candidate should have a strong interest in developing embedded software, a passion for solving complex problems and a team player attitude 
with a solid work ethic. This person will be one of several developers working within a team of experienced software, hardware and test engineers in 
an agile development environment. The selected graduate candidate will receive mentoring and coaching. This role will contribute to the design, 
development, debugging, integration and support of system timing and synchronization software features resident on the Smart Services Router.

With a backplane capacity of 16 Tbps and a non-blocking switching fabric, the Smart Services Router can scale to the bandwidth needs of even the most 
demanding applications, while protecting low-bandwidth, low-latency applications from getting crowded out. State-of-the-art signaling capacities 
address the growing control overhead that comes with an ever-increasing number of connected end-user devices. A variety of network functions – 
ranging from subscriber management to policy control and mobility support – enables a fast and simple introduction of new end-user services, 
maximum end-user experience, and optimal use of network resources. Sophisticated availability and resilience capabilities, encompassing 
both hardware and software, minimize the probability and the potential impact of a failure.

As a consolidated platform for both fixed and mobile network functions, the Smart Services Router realizes complete convergence between network 
access types. Its proven and renowned operating system provides functional convergence complemented by a coherent interface for all network functions. 
This simplifies operations and reduces the cost of ownership
